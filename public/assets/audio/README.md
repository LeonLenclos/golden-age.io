# Naming convention for audio files

## general

* The numbering starts at 0
* For action sound effects, the first number is the **intensity** of the action. It goes from 0 to 2. `0` for one unit doing the action, `1` for two units, `2` for 3 or more units.
* The last number is the **variation**. If a sound has more than one variation, the game will choose one at random. If there is no variation, still write `-0`
* Try to have the same number of variations for sounds of the same category. e.g. 3 variations for `actions-`, no variations for `new-`...
